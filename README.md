# Playwright_Typescript

This is my testing framework in Playwright with Typescript for the demo website https://www.saucedemo.com.

This project is a duplication of the tests from the https://github.com/AdrianCiuciui/Selenium-Java-Maven-TestNG-Project. 
Similar tests, but with different framework and programming language.

GitHub Actions is set up and it is running after each commit.

Mapped only the necessary elements.
